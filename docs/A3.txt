QUESTIONS
==============

Q. Discuss the pros and cons of deleting all versions if a file is deleted in the mount directory.

A. A significant con to deleting all versions if the current file is deleted is it cannot be recovered if the user
changes their mind in the future.
For the same reasons as above deleting versions makes the user vulnerable to accidently deleting files and not being
able to recover their files.
One pro would be space efficiency, keeping versions for a lot of files would quickly become space inefficent, deleting
versions helps prevent using to much memory.
